We teach our student athletes how to play the game, allowing for a smooth transition into our highly competitive AAU Program.  Several College Coaches at all three levels DI, DII, DIII have stated that CWB is the ONLY PROGRAM on the East Coast that plays at this AAU Level without recruitment or open tryout.  Overall winning percentage in the program is 65% at a Regional/National Level.  Virtually ALL CWB Tournaments are Collegiate Exposure Tournaments. Our Staff is second to none, with the players best interest and development in the heart of every practice/game. We play in the most competitive live events available, allowing our players vast exposure to College Coaches.  CWB takes its athletes extremely seriously and always has the needed time to discuss progress with parents. Reaching your goal is our number one priority.</p>
