                    <p>"Chris Ward Basketball (CWB) is an outstanding basketball situation to put a good player into so that he can become better.  Chris Ward came and spoke with my staff for 3 hours as a 1 man clinic and it’s clear that he has drive and passion as well as the X and 0 knowledge to take any player to another level. Chris instills his drive, passion and discipline into his players so that they can reach their potential both on and off the court;  which includes the classroom and the community.   Chris breaks the game down and gives players individual development and skills which can make them better players in any program or system. He instills a greater understanding of the game which can take a kid to the next level. "<br><br>
